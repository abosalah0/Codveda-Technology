# Codveda Machine Learning Internship Tasks

This repository contains my completed internship tasks for **Codveda Technology**, covering beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels of machine learning.

## 📌 Completed Tasks
1. **Task 1 (Beginner)** – *Data Preprocessing (House Dataset)*  
   - Cleaned and parsed raw space-delimited data.  
   - Handled categorical (`CHAS`, `RAD`) and numeric features.  
   - Applied **One-Hot Encoding** and **Standard Scaling**.  
   - Final dataset: **22 features**, train/test split (404/102).  

2. **Task 3 (Intermediate)** – *K-Means Clustering (Iris Dataset)*  
   - Scaled data and applied **K-Means clustering**.  
   - Used the **Elbow Method** to select optimal k = 3.  
   - Reduced dimensions with PCA and visualized clusters.  
   - Clusters aligned well with actual Iris species.  

3. **Task 2 (Advanced)** – *Support Vector Machine (Churn Dataset)*  
   - Preprocessed categorical & numeric features using pipelines.  
   - Compared **Linear vs RBF kernels**.  
   - Results:  
     - Linear → Accuracy = 0.858, Recall = 0.000, AUC = 0.769 (failed to detect churn).  
     - RBF → Accuracy = 0.925, Precision = 0.817, Recall = 0.611, AUC = 0.930.  
   - RBF kernel significantly outperformed Linear.

## 🚀 Highlights
- Full ML workflow: preprocessing, clustering, classification.  
- Cross-validation, confusion matrices, ROC curves, and PCA visualizations.  
- Clear Colab notebooks with explanations and Markdown summaries.
